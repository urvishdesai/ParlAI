In order to run one of our trained models in the interactive mode, all you have to do is run the interactive.py script
  in the examples folder by passing the model name (-m) and model file (-mf) as command line arguments.
For example : python examples/interactive.py -m seq2seq -mf "37k_seq2seq_10.checkpoint". This will run the model trained 
  and stored in a file named 37k_seq2seq.checkpoint, where the type of model is seq2seq
  
The model files are stored on Google Drive and are accessible to anyone with the links to them. The following are their
  links :
